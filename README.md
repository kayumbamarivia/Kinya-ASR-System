## 🗣️ KinyaWhisper
KinyaWhisper is a fine-tuned version of OpenAI’s Whisper model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) in Kinyarwanda. It was trained on 102 manually labeled .wav files and serves as a reproducible baseline for speech recognition in low-resource, indigenous languages.

## 🤗 Hugging Face Model

The fine-tuned KinyaWhisper model is publicly available on Hugging Face:

➡️ [https://huggingface.co/benax-rw/KinyaWhisper](https://huggingface.co/benax-rw/KinyaWhisper)

You can use it directly in your code:

```python
from transformers import WhisperProcessor, WhisperForConditionalGeneration
import torchaudio

# Load fine-tuned KinyaWhisper model and processor from Hugging Face
model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("benax-rw/KinyaWhisper")
processor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained("benax-rw/KinyaWhisper")

# Load and preprocess audio
waveform, sample_rate = torchaudio.load("your_audio.wav")
inputs = processor(waveform.squeeze(), sampling_rate=sample_rate, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate prediction
predicted_ids = model.generate(inputs["input_features"])
transcription = processor.batch_decode(predicted_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]

print("🗣️ Transcription:", transcription)
```

## 🏋️ Taining Details
•	Model: openai/whisper-small
•	Epochs: 80
•	Batch size: 4
•	Learning rate: 1e-5
•	Optimizer: Adam
•	Final loss: 0.00024
•	WER: 51.85%

## ⚠️Limitations
The model was trained on a small dataset (102 samples). It performs best on short, clear Kinyarwanda utterances and may struggle with longer or noisy audio. This is an early-stage educational model, not yet suitable for production use.
